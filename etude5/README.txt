COSC326- Etude5 2022 Semester One.
Look Whos Talking.
@author George Churton & Dougal Colquhoun.

This program takes simple english sentences and translates them to Te Reo Maori.
The program is built on two key files.

These files include:
input.txt - this is the file where english sentences are stored for its foreseeable translation.
translator.java - this is the file where english from input.txt is computationally processed into Te Reo.

----Testing----
Initally we tested the program using the examples given in the Etude5 pdf.
We then compared these examples with the output provided-- searching for any irregularities.
Once the output was looking accurate we then tested other lines of input.
We made sure these lines of input used a range of verbs, listeners and were set in past, present and future tenses.
